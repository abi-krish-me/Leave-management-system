# Leave-management-system

I have used React js, Nodejs and Mysql. 

The system will have functionalities 
  1)to add employees to the database when an employee is added to the database and respective numbers of leave are created in the database, 
  2)view all the employee details, 
  3)view selected employee details, 
  4)update the leaves by selecting the respective employee by updating the remaining leaves, 
  5)allow deletion of employee details when employee retires the company. 

In the sql, database named "employeeleave" will have one table named "employee". 
employee table will have columns named employeeID, name, position, casualLeave, medicalLeave and annualLeave. 
employeeID will be the primary key and it will automatically increment when data is added. 

The sql file in the github should be imported within the database named employeeleave.
